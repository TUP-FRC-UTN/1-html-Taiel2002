    <p title="Este texto es importante"><b>Lorem Ipsum <b/> is simply dummy text of the printing and 
    typesetting industry.<b><i> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since 
    the 1500s</i><b/>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
    specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the 
    release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
    publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem <a href="index2.html">Ipsum.</a></p>
